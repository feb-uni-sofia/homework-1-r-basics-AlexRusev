# c) - since y is shorter than x, the elements of y (2 elements: 1 and 4) are repeated until y
# becomes the same length as x (we get y <- c(1,4,1,4)) and this can only happen if the longer
# vector's length is a multiple of the shorter vector's legth. In our case this holds true and
# we get x(4,1,1,4)-y(1,4,1,4)=z(3,-3,0,0)
z <- x-y

# d)
s <- c(x, y)

# e)
length <- rep(s, 10)
